# battleship
The classic board game, written in vanilla javascript. Features include drag-and-drop ship functionality, random
board generation, smart NPC decisions, and hit/miss animations.

This app began as my solution to The Odin Project javascript course project 12. I have iterated upon it over time 
with new features as I learn more about frontend development.
